## Instructions

* Choose your level - Easy, Medium, Hard or Expert.
* Each level has a few different themes to choose from.
* Select which theme you prefer.

* Now, click on a card to turn it over, and then try to find the matching card! _(You can only have two cards flipped over at once!)_
* If you get it right, the matched cards will stay face-up.
* If you get it wrong, they will turn back over so you can select them again.

* Try to find all the pairs in the deck in as little moves as possible!
* You start with 3 stars, can you keep them all?
* A timer will start when you make your first choice, try to beat your score!

* If you would like to restart your game at any game, simply press the restart button at the top.
